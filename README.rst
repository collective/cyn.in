License incompatibility
=======================

Unfortunately cyn.in is licensed under the GPL 3, while Plone 4 is licensed
exclusively under the GPL 2.

Thus these two cannot be used together. As Plone deliberately changed its
license to GPL 2 for its forth version, the only realistic way to resolve
this is to have cyn.in be relicensed.

If you are interested in working on this, please contact the cyn.in
copyright holders.
